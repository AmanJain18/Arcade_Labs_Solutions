# Creating a Virtual Machine || [GSP001]

## What this Lab is About
This lab guides you through the process of creating virtual machines (VMs) using Google Cloud's Compute Engine. You'll learn to deploy VMs running various operating systems, configure a web server, and manage these instances using both the Google Cloud console and the gcloud command line tool.

## Real-Life Application
Understanding how to create and manage VMs is crucial for deploying scalable applications, managing compute resources efficiently, and ensuring robust performance. These skills are applicable in many real-world scenarios, such as web hosting, application deployment, and infrastructure management.

## What You'll Do
1. Create a VM with the Cloud console.
2. Create a VM with the gcloud command line.
3. Deploy a web server and connect it to a VM.

## Commands to Run in Cloud Shell
Run the following commands to complete the lab tasks:

```bash
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/AmanJain18/Arcade_Labs_Solutions/main/Creating%20a%20Virtual%20Machine/gsp001.sh
