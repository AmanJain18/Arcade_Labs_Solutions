### Navigate to Bigquery :-  
#### Replace the `TABLE_NAME , FARE_AMOUNT , TRIP_DISTANCE , FARE_AMOUNT_NUMBER ,PASSENGER_COUNT` IN BELOW CODE AND RUN QUERY

```bash
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  taxirides.TABLE_NAME AS
SELECT
  (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS FARE_AMOUNT,
  pickup_datetime,
  pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
  pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
  dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
  dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
  passenger_count AS passengers,
FROM
  taxirides.historical_taxi_rides_raw
WHERE
  RAND() < 0.001
  AND trip_distance > TRIP_DISTANCE
  AND fare_amount >= FARE_AMOUNT_NUMBER
  AND pickup_longitude > -78
  AND pickup_longitude < -70
  AND dropoff_longitude > -78
  AND dropoff_longitude < -70
  AND pickup_latitude > 37
  AND pickup_latitude < 45
  AND dropoff_latitude > 37
  AND dropoff_latitude < 45
  AND passenger_count > PASSENGER_COUNT
```

#### Replace the `MODEL_NAME , FARE_AMOUNT , TABLE_NAME` IN BELOW CODE AND RUN QUERY

```bash
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL taxirides.MODEL_NAME
TRANSFORM(
  * EXCEPT(pickup_datetime)

  , ST_Distance(ST_GeogPoint(pickuplon, pickuplat), ST_GeogPoint(dropofflon, dropofflat)) AS euclidean
  , CAST(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime) AS STRING) AS dayofweek
  , CAST(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS STRING) AS hourofday
)
OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['FARE_AMOUNT'], model_type='linear_reg')
AS

SELECT * FROM taxirides.TABLE_NAME
```
### Wait for above Query to get `execute`
#### Replace the `MODEL_NAME` IN BELOW CODE AND RUN QUERY

```bash
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxirides.2015_fare_amount_predictions
  AS
SELECT * FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL taxirides.MODEL_NAME,(
  SELECT * FROM taxirides.report_prediction_data)
)
```
